# 🍇 Winery Inventory Management System

#### A robust inventory management system for wineries, developed using modern web technologies to facilitate effective inventory tracking and management.

#### By **Brian Kinyanjui Gathui**

## 📋 Description

The Winery Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing wine products in a winery. The application allows winery staff to browse available wines, view detailed information, add new wines, edit existing wine details, and remove outdated products. The app uses JSON-Server as a backend to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Pagination was implemented as well to enhance the user experience.

- **➕ Add New Wines:** Add new wine entries to the inventory with details including type, origin, and vintage.
- **✏️ Edit Wine Details:** Update wine information to keep details accurate, including stock levels and tasting notes.
- **🗑️ Delete Wines:** Remove outdated or discontinued wine products to keep the inventory current.

## 🚀 Features to Look Forward to

- **🔒 User Authentication:** Secure inventory management functions with role-based access.
- **🌑 Dark Mode:** Comfortable viewing experience for staff under different working conditions.
- **🔍 Advanced Filtering and Sorting:** Sort and filter wines by various categories such as country, grape, or price.
